<td style="text-align: center;">The generation and control of entanglement in a quantum mechanical system is a critical element of nearly all quantum applications. Molecular systems are a promising candidate, with numerous degrees of freedom able to be targeted. However, knowledge of inter-system entanglement mechanisms in such systems is limited. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of entanglement between vibrational degrees of freedom in molecules via strong coupling to a cavity mode driven by a weak coherent field. In a bi-molecular system, we show entanglement can not only be generated between the cavity and molecular system, but also between molecules. This process also results in the generation of non-classical states of light, providing potential pathways for harnessing entanglement in molecular systems.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Amorphous materials are also distinguished from crystals by their thermal properties. The structural disorder seems to be responsible both for a significant increase in heat capacity compared to crystals of the same composition, but also for a significant decrease in thermal conductivity. The temperature dependence of thermal conductivity, unusual for common interpretations of solid-state physics, gave rise to a lot of debates. We review in this article different interpretations of thermal conductivity in amorphous materials. We show finally that the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity in dielectric materials can be understood by relating it to the disorder-dependent harmonic vibrational eigenmodes.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">This research aims to explore the security risks posed by compatibility and protocol differences in smart contract migration, using the migration of smart contracts from Ethereum to Arbitrum as a case study. Through literature review, online data collection, expert participation, and analysis of smart contract vulnerability cases, this paper conducts an in-depth research of the differences between Ethereum and Arbitrum in areas such as Messaging, Block Properties, Contract Address Alias, and Gas Fees. The research findings indicate the presence of certain security issues during the migration process from Ethereum to Arbitrum, such as abnormal operation of the sequencer resulting in outdated off-chain data retrieval, time-based logical errors, failed permission checks, DOS attacks, and gas loss due to L1-to-L2 transaction failures. To address these security issues, this paper proposes corresponding solutions and recommendations to ensure the security and meet the requirements of the migration process. Additionally, this research emphasizes the continued attention and support for the security issues of smart contract migration through the case of smart contract migration from Ethereum to Arbitrum. It is worth noting that this research is the first in-depth research of smart contract security migration from Ethereum to Arbitrum.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">In this work, we present the modelling and numerical simulation of a molten glass fluid flow in a furnace melting basin. We first derive a model for a molten glass fluid flow and present numerical simulations based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). We further discuss and validate the results obtained from the simulations by comparing them with experimental results. Finally, we also present a non-intrusive Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to efficiently handle scenarios which require multiple simulations of the fluid flow upon changing parameters of relevant industrial interest. This approach lets us obtain solutions of a complex 3D model, with good accuracy with respect to the FEM solution, yet with negligible associated computational times.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Integrated photonic chips have significant potential in telecommunications, classic computing, quantum systems, and topological photonics. Direct laser writing offers unique capability for creating three-dimensional photonic devices in an optical glass chip with quick prototyping. However, existing laser writing schemes cannot create index-modified structures in glass that precisely match the laser focal shape while also achieving high scanning speed and high refractive index contrast. Here, we introduce the theory of a refractive index modification scheme that combines the advantages of both traditional non-thermal and thermal regime fabrication methods. We also propose a model of waveguide formation that was verified through a thorough study on the effects of phase aberrations on the laser focus. The presented new photonic chip fabrication scheme uses a novel focal intensity distribution, where pulse energy is relocated to the bottom of a laser focus by manipulating primary and higher order spherical aberrations. The technique can produce index modifications with high scanning speed (20 mm/s or higher), high index contrast (16 x 10-3), and high precision to fabricate with arbitrary cross-sections. This method has potential to expand the capabilities of photonic chips in applications that require small-scale, high precision, or high contrast refractive index control.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Neuromorphic visual sensors are artificial retinas that output sequences of asynchronous events when brightness changes occur in the scene. These sensors offer many advantages including very high temporal resolution, no motion blur and smart data compression ideal for real-time processing. In this study, we introduce an event-based dataset on fine-grained manipulation actions and perform an experimental study on the use of transformers for action prediction with events. There is enormous interest in the fields of cognitive robotics and human-robot interaction on understanding and predicting human actions as early as possible. Early prediction allows anticipating complex stages for planning, enabling effective and real-time interaction. Our Transformer network uses events to predict manipulation actions as they occur, using online inference. The model succeeds at predicting actions early on, building up confidence over time and achieving state-of-the-art classification. Moreover, the attention-based transformer architecture allows us to study the role of the spatio-temporal patterns selected by the model. Our experiments show that the Transformer network captures action dynamic features outperforming video-based approaches and succeeding with scenarios where the differences between actions lie in very subtle cues. Finally, we release the new event dataset, which is the first in the literature for manipulation action recognition. Code will be available at https://github.com/DaniDeniz/EventVisionTransformer.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Simulating physical systems on quantum devices is one of the most promising applications of quantum technology. Current quantum approaches to simulating open quantum systems are still practically challenging on NISQ-era devices, because they typically require ancilla qubits and extensive controlled sequences. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical approach for simulating a class of open system dynamics called random-unitary channels. These channels naturally decompose into a series of convex unitary evolutions, which can then be efficiently sampled and run as independent circuits. The method does not require deep ancilla frameworks and thus can be implemented with lower noise costs. We implement simulations of open quantum systems up to dozens of qubits and with large channel rank.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Fully-unsupervised Person and Vehicle Re-Identification have received increasing attention due to their broad applicability in surveillance, forensics, event understanding, and smart cities, without requiring any manual annotation. However, most of the prior art has been evaluated in datasets that have just a couple thousand samples. Such small-data setups often allow the use of costly techniques in time and memory footprints, such as Re-Ranking, to improve clustering results. Moreover, some previous work even pre-selects the best clustering hyper-parameters for each dataset, which is unrealistic in a large-scale fully-unsupervised scenario. In this context, this work tackles a more realistic scenario and proposes two strategies to learn from large-scale unlabeled data. The first strategy performs a local neighborhood sampling to reduce the dataset size in each iteration without violating neighborhood relationships. A second strategy leverages a novel Re-Ranking technique, which has a lower time upper bound complexity and reduces the memory complexity from O(n^2) to O(kn) with k &lt;&lt; n. To avoid the pre-selection of specific hyper-parameter values for the clustering algorithm, we also present a novel scheduling algorithm that adjusts the density parameter during training, to leverage the diversity of samples and keep the learning robust to noisy labeling. Finally, due to the complementary knowledge learned by different models, we also introduce a co-training strategy that relies upon the permutation of predicted pseudo-labels, among the backbones, with no need for any hyper-parameters or weighting optimization. The proposed methodology outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in well-known benchmarks and in the challenging large-scale Veri-Wild dataset, with a faster and memory-efficient Re-Ranking strategy, and a large-scale, noisy-robust, and ensemble-based learning approach.</td>

Thus, we fabricate permanent patterns of PEDOT:PSS on glass, followed by a flexible PDMS substrate, and observe conductivity enhancement of 5 times on the former (694 S/cm), and 20 times (2844 S/cm) on the latter, without the use of external doping agents or invasive chemical treatment. Probing the patterned interface, we observe that MBL is able to tune the conformational states of PEDOT:PSS from coils in the pristine form, to extended coils on glass, and almost linear structures in PDMS due to its more malleable liquid-like interface. This results in higher ordering and vanishing grain boundaries leading to the highest conductivity of PEDOT:PSS on PDMS substrates.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">In the present era of advanced technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling smart connected environments. This includes various domains such as smart homes, smart healthcare, smart cities, smart vehicles, and many others.With ubiquitous smart connected devices and systems, a large amount of data associated with them is at a prime risk from malicious entities (e.g., users, devices, applications) in these systems. Innovative technologies, including cloud computing, Machine Learning (ML), and data analytics, support the development of anomaly detection models for the Vehicular Internet of Things (V-IoT), which encompasses collaborative automatic driving and enhanced transportation systems. However, traditional centralized anomaly detection models fail to provide better services for connected vehicles due to issues such as high latency, privacy leakage, performance overhead, and model drift. Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant recognition for its ability to address data privacy concerns in the IoT domain. Digital Twin (DT), proves beneficial in addressing uncertain crises and data security issues by creating a virtual replica that simulates various factors, including traffic trajectories, city policies, and vehicle utilization. However, the effectiveness of a V-IoT DT system heavily relies on the collection of long-term and high-quality data to make appropriate decisions. This paper introduces a Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) based anomaly detection model for V-IoT, aiming to enhance the accuracy of the model. Our proposed model integrates both DT and HFL approaches to create a comprehensive system for detecting malicious activities using an anomaly detection model. Additionally, real-world V-IoT use case scenarios are presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed model.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Syntactic foams have found widespread usage in various applications including, marine, aerospace, automotive, pipe insulation, electrical cable sheathing, and shoe insoles. However, syntactic foams are often exposed to moisture when used in these applications that potentially alter their viscoelastic, thermal transport, and dielectric properties, which influences their long-term durability. Despite their significance, previous research has mainly focused on experimental studies concerning mechanical property changes resulting from filler loading and different matrix materials, overlooking the fundamental mechanisms resulting from moisture exposure. The current paper aims to bridge this gap in knowledge by elucidating the impact of long-term moisture exposure on TPU and TPU-based syntactic foam through multi-scale materials characterization approaches. Here, we choose a flexible syntactic foam manufactured using thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer (TPU) reinforced with glass microballoons (GMB) through selective laser sintering. Specifically, the research investigates the influence of moisture exposure time and the volume fraction of GMB on chemical and microphase morphological changes, along with their associated mechanisms. The study further examines how these microphase morphological changes manifest in viscoelastic, thermal transport, and dielectric properties.</td>

Our paper proposes a privacy-enhancing framework that targets speaker identity anonymization while preserving speech recognition accuracy for our downstream task~-~Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The proposed framework attaches flexible gradient reversal based speaker adversarial layers to target layers within an ASR model, where speaker adversarial training anonymizes acoustic embeddings generated by the targeted layers to remove speaker identity. We propose on-device deployment by execution of initial layers of the ASR model, and transmitting anonymized embeddings to the cloud, where the rest of the model is executed while preserving privacy. Experimental results show that our method efficiently reduces speaker recognition relative accuracy by 33%, and improves ASR performance by achieving 6.2% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and bicyclists, are at a higher risk of being involved in crashes with motor vehicles, and crashes involving VRUs also are more likely to result in severe injuries or fatalities. Signalized intersections are a major safety concern for VRUs due to their complex and dynamic nature, highlighting the need to understand how these road users interact with motor vehicles and deploy evidence-based countermeasures to improve safety performance. Crashes involving VRUs are relatively infrequent, making it difficult to understand the underlying contributing factors. An alternative is to identify and use conflicts between VRUs and motorized vehicles as a surrogate for safety performance. Automatically detecting these conflicts using a video-based systems is a crucial step in developing smart infrastructure to enhance VRU safety. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation conducted a study using video-based event monitoring system to assess VRU and motor vehicle interactions at fifteen signalized intersections across Pennsylvania to improve VRU safety performance. This research builds on that study to assess the reliability of automatically generated surrogates in predicting confirmed conflicts using advanced data-driven models. The surrogate data used for analysis include automatically collectable variables such as vehicular and VRU speeds, movements, post-encroachment time, in addition to manually collected variables like signal states, lighting, and weather conditions. The findings highlight the varying importance of specific surrogates in predicting true conflicts, some being more informative than others. The findings can assist transportation agencies to collect the right types of data to help prioritize infrastructure investments, such as bike lanes and crosswalks, and evaluate their effectiveness.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Camera-based autonomous systems that emulate human perception are increasingly being integrated into safety-critical platforms. Consequently, an established body of literature has emerged that explores adversarial attacks targeting the underlying machine learning models. Adapting adversarial attacks to the physical world is desirable for the attacker, as this removes the need to compromise digital systems. However, the real world poses challenges related to the "survivability" of adversarial manipulations given environmental noise in perception pipelines and the dynamicity of autonomous systems. In this paper, we take a sensor-first approach. We present EvilEye, a man-in-the-middle perception attack that leverages transparent displays to generate dynamic physical adversarial examples. EvilEye exploits the camera's optics to induce misclassifications under a variety of illumination conditions. To generate dynamic perturbations, we formalize the projection of a digital attack into the physical domain by modeling the transformation function of the captured image through the optical pipeline. Our extensive experiments show that EvilEye's generated adversarial perturbations are much more robust across varying environmental light conditions relative to existing physical perturbation frameworks, achieving a high attack success rate (ASR) while bypassing state-of-the-art physical adversarial detection frameworks. We demonstrate that the dynamic nature of EvilEye enables attackers to adapt adversarial examples across a variety of objects with a significantly higher ASR compared to state-of-the-art physical world attack frameworks. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies against the EvilEye attack.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">We study the spin-glass transition in several Ising models of relevance for quantum annealers. We extract the spin-glass critical temperature by extrapolating the pseudo-critical properties obtained with Replica-Exchange Monte-Carlo for finite-size systems. We find a spin-glass phase for some random lattices (random-regular and small-world graphs) in good agreement with previous results. However, our results for the quasi-two-dimensional graphs implemented in the D-Wave annealers (Chimera, Zephyr, and Pegasus) indicate only a zero-temperature spin-glass state, as their pseudo-critical temperature drifts towards smaller values. This implies that the asymptotic runtime to find the low-energy configuration of those graphs is likely to be polynomial in system size, nevertheless, this scaling may only be reached for very large system sizes -- much larger than existing annealers -- as we observe an abrupt increase in the computational cost of the simulations around the pseudo-critical temperatures. Thus, two-dimensional systems with local crossings can display enough complexity to make unfeasible the search with classical methods of low-energy configurations.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Smart roadside infrastructure sensors in the form of intelligent transportation system stations (ITS-Ss) are increasingly deployed worldwide at relevant traffic nodes. The resulting digital twins of the real environment are suitable for developing and validating connected and automated driving functions and for increasing the operational safety of intelligent vehicles by providing ITS-S real-time data. However, ITS-Ss are very costly to establish and operate. The choice of sensor technology also has an impact on the overall costs as well as on the data quality. So far, there is only insufficient knowledge about the concrete expenses that arise with the construction of different ITS-S setups. Within this work, multiple modular infrastructure sensor setups are investigated with the help of a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA). Their economic efficiency, different user requirements and sensor data qualities are considered. Based on the static cost model, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed, to generate a range of possible project costs and to quantify the financial risks of implementing ITS-S projects of different scales. Due to its modularity, the calculation model is suitable for diverse applications and outputs a distinctive evaluation of the underlying cost-benefit ratio of investigated setups.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">The boson peak (BP), a low-energy excess in the vibrational density of states over the phonon Debye contribution, is usually identified as one of the distinguishing features between ordered crystals and amorphous solid materials. Despite decades of efforts, its microscopic origin still remains a mystery and a consensus on its theoretical derivation has not yet been achieved. Recently, it has been proposed, and corroborated with simulations, that the BP might stem from intrinsic localized modes which involve string-like excitations ("stringlets") having a one-dimensional (1D) nature. In this work, we build on a theoretical framework originally proposed by Lund that describes the localized modes as 1D vibrating strings, but we specify the stringlet size distribution to be exponential, as observed in independent simulation studies. We show that a generalization of this framework provides an analytically prediction for the BP frequency $\omega_{BP}$ in the temperature regime well below the glass transition temperature in both 2D and 3D amorphous systems. The final result involves no free parameters and is in quantitative agreement with prior simulation observations. Additionally, this stringlet theory of the BP naturally reproduces the softening of the BP frequency upon heating and offers an analytical explanation for the experimentally observed scaling with the shear modulus in the glass state and changes in this scaling in cooled liquids. Finally, the theoretical analysis highlights the existence of a strong damping for the stringlet modes at finite temperature which leads to a large low-frequency contribution to the 3D vibrational density of states, as observed in both experiments and simulations.</td>

Long-lasting temporal-history dependence of the microscopic dynamics and nonlinear rheology are incorporated through the mode-coupling theory of the glass transition (MCT). The theory's integral constitutive equation (ICE) is coupled to continuum mechanics in a finite-element method (FEM) scheme that tracks the flow history through the Finger tensor. The method is suitable for a calculation of residual stresses from a "first-principles" starting point following well-understood approximations. As an example, we calculate within a schematic version of MCT the stress-induced optical birefringence pattern of an amorphous solid cast into the shape of a slab with a cylindrical obstacle and demonstrate how FEM-MCT can predict the dependence of material properties on the material's processing history.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">With the increasing interconnection of smart devices, users often desire to adopt the same app on quite different devices for identical tasks, such as watching the same movies on both their smartphones and TV.   However, the significant differences in screen size, aspect ratio, and interaction styles make it challenging to adapt Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) across these devices.   Although there are millions of apps available on Google Play, only a few thousand are designed to support smart TV displays.   Existing techniques to map a mobile app GUI to a TV either adopt a responsive design, which struggles to bridge the substantial gap between phone and TV or use mirror apps for improved video display, which requires hardware support and extra engineering efforts.   Instead of developing another app for supporting TVs, we propose a semi-automated approach to generate corresponding adaptive TV GUIs, given the phone GUIs as the input.   Based on our empirical study of GUI pairs for TV and phone in existing apps, we synthesize a list of rules for grouping and classifying phone GUIs, converting them to TV GUIs, and generating dynamic TV layouts and source code for the TV display.   Our tool is not only beneficial to developers but also to GUI designers, who can further customize the generated GUIs for their TV app development.   An evaluation and user study demonstrate the accuracy of our generated GUIs and the usefulness of our tool.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Amorphous polymers are considered promising materials for separations due to their excellent transport properties and low fabrication costs. The separation performance of a membrane material is characterized by its permeability (overall throughput of components), and selectivity (efficiency of separation). Both permeability and selectivity are controlled by the diffusion of different penetrants through the matrix, which is strongly influenced by the distribution and morphology of the free volume elements (FVEs). FVEs are void spaces in the polymer matrix that result from the inefficient packing of bulky and rigid groups on the polymer backbone. Thus, FVEs dictate the efficiency of membrane polymers, and it is imperative to understand how processing conditions such as high pressure influence their structure. In this paper, we apply uniaxial tensile deformation on three polymers, namely polystyrene (PS), polymethylpentene (PMP), and HAB-6FDA thermally rearranged polymer (TRP), at varying temperatures and strain rates. We calculate the stress strain curve, tensile modulus, and free volume element evolution at these conditions. We find that PMP and PS with low and moderate glass transition temperature, respectively, exhibit the most change in mechanical properties as a function of strain rate and temperature. The properties of TRP, however, do not vary as much. We also find that FVEs become larger with deformation, and the extent of this change is in line with the overall change of mechanical properties of the material.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Transparent objects present multiple distinct challenges to visual perception systems. First, their lack of distinguishing visual features makes transparent objects harder to detect and localize than opaque objects. Even humans find certain transparent surfaces with little specular reflection or refraction, like glass doors, difficult to perceive. A second challenge is that depth sensors typically used for opaque object perception cannot obtain accurate depth measurements on transparent surfaces due to their unique reflective properties. Stemming from these challenges, we observe that transparent object instances within the same category, such as cups, look more similar to each other than to ordinary opaque objects of that same category. Given this observation, the present paper explores the possibility of category-level transparent object pose estimation rather than instance-level pose estimation. We propose \textit{\textbf{TransNet}}, a two-stage pipeline that estimates category-level transparent object pose using localized depth completion and surface normal estimation. TransNet is evaluated in terms of pose estimation accuracy on a large-scale transparent object dataset and compared to a state-of-the-art category-level pose estimation approach. Results from this comparison demonstrate that TransNet achieves improved pose estimation accuracy on transparent objects. Moreover, we use TransNet to build an autonomous transparent object manipulation system for robotic pick-and-place and pouring tasks.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Security has become a main concern for the smart grid to move from research and development to industry. The concept of security has usually referred to resistance to threats by an active or passive attacker. However, since smart meters (SMs) are often placed in unprotected areas, physical security has become one of the important security goals in the smart grid. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) have been largely utilized for ensuring physical security in recent years, though their reliability has remained a major problem to be practically used in cryptographic applications. Although fuzzy extractors have been considered as a solution to solve the reliability problem of PUFs, they put a considerable computational cost to the resource-constrained SMs. To that end, we first propose an on-chip-error-correcting (OCEC) PUF that efficiently generates stable digits for the authentication process. Afterward, we introduce a lightweight authentication protocol between the SMs and neighborhood gateway (NG) based on the proposed PUF. The provable security analysis shows that not only the proposed protocol can stand secure in the Canetti-Krawczyk (CK) adversary model but also provides additional security features. Also, the performance evaluation demonstrates the significant improvement of the proposed scheme in comparison with the state-of-the-art.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Color can originate from wavelength-dependence in the absorption of pigments or the scattering of nanostructures. While synthetic colors are dominated by the former, vivid structural colors found in nature have inspired much research on the latter. However, many of the most vibrant colors in nature involve the interactions of structure and pigment. Here, we demonstrate that pigment can be exploited to efficiently create bright structural color at wavelengths outside its absorption band. We created pigment-enhanced Bragg reflectors by sequentially spin-coating layers of poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) and polystyrene (PS) loaded with $\beta$-carotene (BC). With only 10 double layers, we acheived a peak reflectance over $0.8$ at 550 nm and normal incidence. A pigment-free multilayer made of the same materials would require 25 double layers to achieve the same reflectance. Further, pigment loading suppressed the Bragg reflector's characteristic iridescence. Using numerical simulations, we further show that similar pigment loadings could significantly expand the gamut of non-iridescent colors addressable by photonic glasses.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Vehicle count prediction is an important aspect of smart city traffic management. Most major roads are monitored by cameras with computing and transmitting capabilities. These cameras provide data to the central traffic controller (CTC), which is in charge of traffic control management. In this paper, we propose a joint CNN-LSTM-based semantic communication (SemCom) model in which the semantic encoder of a camera extracts the relevant semantics from raw images. The encoded semantics are then sent to the CTC by the transmitter in the form of symbols. The semantic decoder of the CTC predicts the vehicle count on each road based on the sequence of received symbols and develops a traffic management strategy accordingly. An optimization problem to improve the quality of experience (QoE) is introduced and numerically solved, taking into account constraints such as vehicle user safety, transmit power of camera devices, vehicle count prediction accuracy, and semantic entropy. Using numerical results, we show that the proposed SemCom model reduces overhead by $54.42\%$ when compared to source encoder/decoder methods. Also, we demonstrate through simulations that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and QoE.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">In transition-metal-oxide heterostructures, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a powerful tool for detecting the magnetic state and revealing intriguing interfacial magnetic orderings. However, achieving a larger AHE at room temperature in oxide heterostructures is still challenging due to the dilemma of mutually strong spin-orbit coupling and magnetic exchange interactions. Here, we exploit the Ru doping-enhanced AHE in LSMRO epitaxial films. As the B-site Ru doping level increases up to 20 percent, the anomalous Hall resistivity at room temperature can be enhanced from nOhmcm to uOhmcm scale. Ru doping leads to strong competition between ferromagnetic double-exchange interaction and antiferromagnetic super-exchange interaction. The resultant spin frustration and spin-glass state facilitate a strong skew-scattering process, thus significantly enhancing the extrinsic AHE. Our findings could pave a feasible approach for boosting the controllability and reliability of oxide-based spintronic devices.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is currently the largest decentralized storage solution in operation, with thousands of active participants and millions of daily content transfers. IPFS is used as remote data storage for numerous blockchain-based smart contracts, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), and decentralized applications.   We present a content censorship attack that can be executed with minimal effort and cost, and that prevents the retrieval of any chosen content in the IPFS network. The attack exploits a conceptual issue in a core component of IPFS, the Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT), which is used to resolve content IDs to peer addresses. We provide efficient detection and mitigation mechanisms for this vulnerability. Our mechanisms achieve a 99.6\% detection rate and mitigate 100\% of the detected attacks with minimal signaling and computational overhead. We followed responsible disclosure procedures, and our countermeasures are scheduled for deployment in the future versions of IPFS.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Accident detection and traffic analysis is a critical component of smart city and autonomous transportation systems that can reduce accident frequency, severity and improve overall traffic management. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of traffic accidents in different regions across the United States using data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS). To address the challenges of accident detection and traffic analysis, this paper proposes a framework that uses traffic surveillance cameras and action recognition systems to detect and respond to traffic accidents spontaneously. Integrating the proposed framework with emergency services will harness the power of traffic cameras and machine learning algorithms to create an efficient solution for responding to traffic accidents and reducing human errors. Advanced intelligence technologies, such as the proposed accident detection systems in smart cities, will improve traffic management and traffic accident severity. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into traffic accidents in the US and presents a practical solution to enhance the safety and efficiency of transportation systems.</td>
