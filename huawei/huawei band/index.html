<td style="text-align: center;">null</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">We predict energetically and dynamically stable ternary Carbon-Phosphorous-Arsenic (CPAs2) monolayers in buckled geometric structure by employing density functional theory based calculations. We consider three different symmetric configurations, namely, inversion (i), mirror (m) and rotational (r). The low-energy dispersions in electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) around the Fermi level contain two contrasting features: (a) parabolic dispersion around highly symmetric Gamma point with a step function in DOS due to nearly-free-particle-like Schroedinger-Fermions and (b) linear dispersion around highly symmetric K point with linear DOS due to massless Dirac-Fermions for i-CPAs2 monolayer. The step function in DOS is a consequence of two-dimensionality of the system in which the motion of nearly-free-particles is confined. However, a closer look at (b) reveals that the ternary monolayers possess distinct characters, namely (i) massless-gapless, (ii) slightly massive-gapped and (iii) unpinned massless-gapless Dirac-Fermions for i, m and r-CPAs2 configurations respectively. Thus, the nature of states around the Fermi level depends crucially on the symmetry of systems. In addition, we probe the influence of mechanical strain on the properties of CPAs2 monolayer. The results indicate that the characteristic dispersions of (a) and (b) move in opposite directions in energy which leads to a metal-to-semimetal transition in i and r-CPAs2 configurations, for a few percentages of tensile strain. On the other hand, a strain induced metal-to-semiconductor transition is observed in m-CPAs2 configuration with a tunable energy band gap. Interestingly, unlike graphene, the Dirac cones can be unpinned from highly symmetric K (and K') point, but they are restricted to move along the edges (K-M'-K') of first Brillouin zone due to C2 symmetry in i and r-CPAs2 configurations.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">null</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">We use a combination of unsupervised clustering and sparsity-promoting inference algorithms to learn locally dominant force balances that explain macroscopic pattern formation in self-organized active particle systems. The self-organized emergence of macroscopic patterns from microscopic interactions between self-propelled particles can be widely observed nature. Although hydrodynamic theories help us better understand the physical basis of this phenomenon, identifying a sufficient set of local interactions that shape, regulate, and sustain self-organized structures in active particle systems remains challenging. We investigate a classic hydrodynamic model of self-propelled particles that produces a wide variety of patterns, like asters and moving density bands. Our data-driven analysis shows that propagating bands are formed by local alignment interactions driven by density gradients, while steady-state asters are shaped by a mechanism of splay-induced negative compressibility arising from strong particle interactions. Our method also reveals analogous physical principles of pattern formation in a system where the speed of the particle is influenced by local density. This demonstrates the ability of our method to reveal physical commonalities across models. The physical mechanisms inferred from the data are in excellent agreement with analytical scaling arguments and experimental observations.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">This work presents a new unsupervised framework for training deep learning models for super-resolution of Sentinel-2 images by fusion of its 10-m and 20-m bands. The proposed scheme avoids the resolution downgrade process needed to generate training data in the supervised case. On the other hand, a proper loss that accounts for cycle-consistency between the network prediction and the input components to be fused is proposed. Despite its unsupervised nature, in our preliminary experiments the proposed scheme has shown promising results in comparison to the supervised approach. Besides, by construction of the proposed loss, the resulting trained network can be ascribed to the class of multi-resolution analysis methods.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Future wireless networks and sensing systems will benefit from access to large chunks of spectrum above 100 GHz, to achieve terabit-per-second data rates in 6th Generation (6G) cellular systems and improve accuracy and reach of Earth exploration and sensing and radio astronomy applications. These are extremely sensitive to interference from artificial signals, thus the spectrum above 100~GHz features several bands which are protected from active transmissions under current spectrum regulations. To provide more agile access to the spectrum for both services, active and passive users will have to coexist without harming passive sensing operations. In this paper, we provide the first, fundamental analysis of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) that large-scale terrestrial deployments introduce in different satellite sensing systems now orbiting the Earth. We develop a geometry-based analysis and extend it into a data-driven model which accounts for realistic propagation, building obstruction, ground reflection, for network topology with up to $10^5$ nodes in more than $85$ km$^2$. We show that the presence of harmful RFI depends on several factors, including network load, density and topology, satellite orientation, and building density. The results and methodology provide the foundation for the development of coexistence solutions and spectrum policy towards 6G.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">We consider non-Hermitian energy band theory in two-dimensional systems, and study eigenenergy braids on slices in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone. We show the consequences of reciprocity and geometric symmetry on such eigenenergy braids. The point-gap topology of the energy bands can be found from the projection of the eigenenergy braid onto the complex energy plane. We show that the conjugacy class transitions in the eigenenergy braid results in the changes in the number of bands in a complete point-gap loop. This transition occurs at exceptional points. We numerically demonstrate these concepts using two-dimensional reciprocal and nonreciprocal photonic crystals.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">The triaxial projected shell model (TPSM) approach is generalized to investigate the negative parity band structures in even-even systems. In the earlier version of the TPSM approach, the quasiparticle excitations were restricted to one major oscillator shell and it was possible to study only $+$ive parity states in even-even systems. In the present extension, the excited quasiparticles are allowed to occupy two major oscillator shells, which makes it possible to generate the $-$ive parity states. As a major application of this development, the extended approach is applied to elucidate the $-$ive parity high-spin band structures in $^{102-112}$Ru. It is shown that TPSM approach provides a reasonable description of the observed properties.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Magnetic tunneling junctions (MTJs) are essential for non-volatile magneto-resistive random access memory (MRAM) applications. Here, we report the observation of a large negative tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR) in the CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB system with an orthogonally-magnetized configuration. Through the thickness modulation of the MgO barrier, the negative TMR component can be enhanced up to 20% under a negative voltage bias. Moreover, the tunnel anisotropic magneto-resistance measurements unveil that the negative TMR component likely arises from the interfacial resonance states (IRS) in the minority band of the bottom ferromagnetic layer. Complementary first principle calculations further quantify the IRS location and strength with respect to the Fermi level position. Our work not only confirm the vital role of IRS in the electrical transport of MTJ, but also provide valuable insights for the design of new-generation voltage-controlled MRAM and related spintronic applications.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Spins in semiconductor quantum dots hold great promise as building blocks of quantum processors. Trapping them in SiMOS transistor-like devices eases future industrial scale fabrication. Among the potentially scalable readout solutions, gate-based dispersive radiofrequency reflectometry only requires the already existing transistor gates to readout a quantum dot state, relieving the need for additional elements. In this effort towards scalability, traveling-wave superconducting parametric amplifiers significantly enhance the readout signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by reducing the noise below typical cryogenic low-noise amplifiers, while offering a broad amplification band, essential to multiplex the readout of multiple resonators. In this work, we demonstrate a 3GHz gate-based reflectometry readout of electron charge states trapped in quantum dots formed in SiMOS multi-gate devices, with SNR enhanced thanks to a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA). The broad, tunable 2GHz amplification bandwidth combined with more than 10dB ON/OFF SNR improvement of the JTWPA enables frequency and time division multiplexed readout of interdot transitions, and noise performance near the quantum limit. In addition, owing to a design without superconducting loops and with a metallic ground plane, the JTWPA is flux insensitive and shows stable performances up to a magnetic field of 1.2T at the quantum dot device, compatible with standard SiMOS spin qubit experiments.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Stellar white-light flares are believed to play an essential role on the physical and chemical properties of the atmosphere of the surrounding exoplanets. Here we report an optical monitoring campaign on the nearby flaring system EI~Cnc carried out by the Ground-based Wide Angle Cameras (GWAC) and its dedicated follow-up telescope. A superflare, coming from the brighter component EI~CncA, was detected and observed, in which four components are required to properly model the complex decay light curve. The lower limit of flare energy in the $R-$band is estimated to be $3.3\times10^{32}$ ergs. 27 flares are additionally detected from the GWAC archive data with a total duration of 290 hours. The inferred cumulative flare frequency distribution follows a quite shallow power-law function with a slope of $\beta=-0.50\pm 0.03$ over the energy range between $10^{30}$ and $10^{33}$ erg, which reinforces the trend that stars cooler than M4 show enhanced superflare activity. The flares identified in EI~Cnc enable us to extend the $\tau-E$ relationship previously established in the white-light superflares of solar-type stars down to an energy as low as $\sim10^{30}$erg (i.e., by three orders): $\tau\propto E^{0.42\pm0.02}$, which suggests a common flare mechanism for stars with a type from M to solar-like, and implies an invariant of $B^{1/3}\upsilon_{\rm A}$ in the white-light flares.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Characterizing the physical properties of dust grains in a protoplanetary disk is critical to comprehending the planet formation process. Our study presents ALMA high-resolution observations of the young protoplanetary disk around DG Tau at a 1.3 mm dust continuum. The observations, with a spatial resolution of $\approx 0.04''$, or $\approx5$ au, revealed a geometrically thin and smooth disk without substantial substructures, suggesting that the disk retains the initial conditions of the planet formation. To further analyze the distributions of dust surface density, temperature, and grain size, we conducted a multi-band analysis with several dust models, incorporating ALMA archival data of the 0.87 mm and 3.1 mm dust polarization. The results showed that the Toomre $Q$ parameter is $\lesssim2$ at a 20 au radius, assuming a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.01. This implies that a higher dust-to-gas mass ratio is necessary to stabilize the disk. The grain sizes depend on the dust models, and for the DSHARP compact dust, they were found to be smaller than $\sim400$ $\mu$m in the inner region ($r\lesssim20$ au), while exceeding larger than 3 mm in the outer part. Radiative transfer calculations show that the dust scale height is lower than at least one-third of the gas scale height. These distributions of dust enrichment, grain sizes, and weak turbulence strength may have significant implications for the formation of planetesimals through mechanisms such as streaming instability. We also discuss the CO snowline effect and collisional fragmentation in dust coagulation for the origin of the dust size distribution.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">We study the competition between the electron liquid and solid phases, such as Wigner crystal and bubbles, in partially filled Landau levels (LLs) of multilayer graphene. Graphene systems offer a versatile platform for controlling band dispersion by varying the number of its stacked layers. The band dispersion determines the LL wave functions, and consequently, the LL-projected Coulomb interaction in graphene and its multilayers is different from that in conventional semiconductors like GaAs. As a result, the energies of the liquid and solid phases are different in the different LLs of multilayer graphene, leading to a new phase diagram for the stability of these phases, which we work out. The phase diagram of competing solid and liquid phases in the LLs of monolayer graphene has been studied previously. Here, we primarily consider $AB{-}$ or Bernal$-$stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) and $ABC{-}$stacked trilayer graphene (TLG) and focus on the Laughlin fractions. We determine the cohesive energy of the solid phase using the Hartree-Fock approximation while the energy of the Laughlin liquid is computed analytically via the plasma sum rules. We find that at the Laughlin fillings, the electron liquid phase has the lowest energy among the phases considered in the $\mathcal{N}{=}0, 1, 2$ LLs of BLG, as well as in the $\mathcal{N}{=}3, 4$ LLs of TLG, while in the $\mathcal{N}{&gt;}2$ LLs of BLG and $\mathcal{N}{&gt;}4$ LLs of TLG, the solid phases are more favorable.

Here, we discuss the MIRI imaging, which includes eight pointings, four of which provide deep imaging with the bluer bands (F560W, F770W) and four with contiguous wavelength coverage in F1000W, F1280W, F1500W, and F1800W, where two of these also include coverage in F770W and F2100W. We present a summary of the data, the data quality, and data reduction. The data reduction is based on the JWST Calibration Pipeline combined with custom modifications and additional steps designed to enhance the output quality, including improvements in astrometry and the removal of detector artifacts. We estimate the image depth of the reduced mosaics, and show that these generally agree with expectations from the Exposure Time Calculator. We compare the MIRI F560W and F770W flux densities for bright sources to measurements from Spitzer/IRAC Ch3 (5.8 $\mu$m) and Ch4 (8.0 $\mu$m), and we find that they agree with systematic differences of $&lt;0.1$ mag. For the redder MIRI bands, we assess their quality by studying the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of Galactic stars. The SEDs are consistent with the expected Rayleigh-Jeans law with a deviation $\sim 0.03$ mag, indicating that the MIRI colors are reliable. We also discuss all publicly released data products (images and source catalogs), which are available on the CEERS website (https://ceers.github.io/).</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Aims. Traditional star-galaxy classification techniques often rely on feature estimation from catalogues, a process susceptible to introducing inaccuracies, thereby potentially jeopardizing the classification's reliability. Certain galaxies, especially those not manifesting as extended sources, can be misclassified when their shape parameters and flux solely drive the inference. We aim to create a robust and accurate classification network for identifying stars and galaxies directly from astronomical images. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNN) and additional information about the source position, we aim to accurately classify all stars and galaxies within a survey, particularly those with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) near the detection limit. Methods. The AutoSourceID-Classifier (ASID-C) algorithm developed here uses 32x32 pixel single filter band source cutouts generated by the previously developed ASID-L code. ASID-C utilizes CNNs to distinguish these cutouts into stars or galaxies, leveraging their strong feature-learning capabilities. Subsequently, we employ a modified Platt Scaling calibration for the output of the CNN. This technique ensures that the derived probabilities are effectively calibrated, delivering precise and reliable results. Results. We show that ASID-C, trained on MeerLICHT telescope images and using the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) morphological classification, outperforms similar codes like SourceExtractor. ASID-C opens up new possibilities for accurate celestial object classification, especially for sources with a S/N near the detection limit. Potential applications of ASID-C, like real-time star-galaxy classification and transient's host identification, promise significant contributions to astronomical research.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Tunability of coherent coupling between fundamental excitations is an important prerequisite for expanding their functionality in hybrid quantum systems. In hybrid magnonics, the dipolar interaction between magnon and photon usually persists and cannot be switched off. Here, we demonstrate this capability by coupling a superconducting resonator to a layered hybrid perovskite antiferromagnet, which exhibits a magnon band gap due to its intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The pronounced temperature sensitivity of the magnon band gap location allows us to set the photon mode within the gap and to disable magnon-photon hybridization. When the resonator mode falls into the magnon band gap, the resonator damping rate increases due to the nonzero coupling to the detuned magnon mode. This phenomena can be used to quantify the magnon band gap using an analytical model. Our work brings new opportunities in controlling coherent information processing with quantum properties in complex magnetic materials.</td>

The exceptionally deep images in the ($F115W$, $F150W$, $F200W$) bands reveal a large population of unresolved pointlike sources across the field, the vast majority of which are globular clusters (GCs). To the limits of our photometry, more than 10,000 such objects were measured, most of which are in the halos of the five largest A2744 galaxies but which also include GCs around some satellite galaxies and throughout the IntraCluster Medium. Their luminosity function follows a lognormal shape, with the data reaching to within one magnitude of the classic GCLF turnover point. The colour index ($F115W-F200W$) in particular covers a range of $0.5$ mag, clearly resolving the expected internal spread of GC metallicities. The estimated GC masses are systematically higher than in present-day galaxies, consistent with a large, normal GC population seen at a $3.5~$Gyr earlier stage of dynamical evolution. Lastly, the spatial distribution of the bluer (more metal-poor) GCs resembles the gravitational lensing map of the cluster, consistent with recent theoretical suggestions.</td>

The non-Hermitian tearing manifests in two forms -- bulk state separation and boundary state decoupling. For a deeper understanding of non-Hermitian tearing, we give the effective 2<em>2 Hamiltonian in the k-space by reducing the N</em>N Hamiltonian in the real space. In addition, we also explore the non-Hermitian tearing in the one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Qi-Wu-Zhang model.

<td style="text-align: center;">Recently, much attention has been paid to uncovering the influence of dissipation on a quantum system, particularly on how the non-Hermitian (NH) terms modify the band topology of topological materials and reshape the profile of the wavefunctions of a system (or the NH skin effect). In this paper, a specific NH skin effect that induced by local dissipation is studied for chiral edge modes, in which the NH term corresponds to the local imaginary Fermi velocity of the chiral edge modes. By solving the NH Schr\"{o}dinger equation of the non-Hermitian chiral edge modes (nhCEs) with complex Fermi velocity, we uncovered the remarkable complex spectra and the wavefunctions of the nhCEs. We find that the complex spectra of these modes is a straight line in the topological materials, and its chirality can separates the modes with positive energy from those with negative energy, in which they are localized at different positions. We also studied the nhCEs at the boundary of 2-dimensional (2D) topological materials, the 2D $p$-wave superconductor and the Qi-Wu-Zhang model, in which the general law of nhCEs was verified. We expect that our findings will pave the way for researching the transport properties of the chiral edge modes in the non-equilibrium context.</td>

Mrk 1018 is unique: first classified as a type 1.9 Seyfert galaxy, it transitioned to a type 1 before returning to its initial classification after approximately 30 years. We present a high-cadence monitoring programme that caught a major outburst in 2020. Due to sunblock, only the decline could be observed. We studied X-ray, UV, optical, and IR before and after the outburst to investigate the responses of the AGN structures. We derived a u'-band light curve of the AGN contribution alone. The flux increased by a factor of the order of 13. We confirmed this in other optical bands and determined the shape and speed of the decline in each waveband. The shapes of H beta and H alpha were analysed before and after the event. Two XMM-Newton observations from before and after the outburst were also exploited. The outburst is asymmetric, with a swifter rise than decline. The decline is best fit by a linear function, ruling out a tidal disruption event. The optical spectrum shows no change approximately 8 months before and 17 months after. The UV flux increased slightly after the outburst but the X-ray primary flux is unchanged. However, the 6.4 keV Iron line has doubled in strength. IR data taken 13 days after the observed optical peak show an increased emission level. Calculating the distance of the broad-line region and inner edge of the torus from the supermassive black hole can explain the multi-wavelength response to the outburst, in particular: i) the unchanged H beta and H alpha lines, ii) the unchanged primary X-ray spectral components, iii) the rapid and extended infrared response, as well as iv) the enhanced emission of the reflected 6.4 keV line. The outburst was due to a dramatic and short-lasting change in the intrinsic accretion rate. We discuss different models as potential causes.</td>

GRS 1915+105 is a well-known fast-spinning black-hole X-ray binary with a relativistic jet, termed as a ``microquasar'', as indicated by its superluminal motion of radio emission. It exhibits persistent x-ray activity over the last 30 years, with quasi-periodic oscillations of $\sim 1-10$ Hz and 34 and 67 Hz in the x-ray band. These oscillations likely originate in the inner accretion disk, but other origins have been considered. Radio observations found variable light curves with quasi-periodic flares or oscillations with periods of $\sim 20-50$ minutes. Here we report two instances of $\sim$5 Hz transient periodic oscillation features from the source detected in the 1.05-1.45 GHz radio band that occurred in January 2021 and June 2022, respectively. Circular polarization was also observed during the oscillation phase.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">We theoretically investigate the influence of the normal state quantum geometry on the superconducting phase in (111) oriented oxide interfaces and discuss some of its implications in the case of the $\text{LaAlO}_3/\text{SrTiO}_3$ (LAO/STO) heterostructure. Based on a tight-binding representation of this interface, we introduce a low-energy model for which we compute the quantum geometry of the lowest band. The quantum metric exhibits a high peak around the $\Gamma$ point, owing to the closeness of the band to a degeneracy point, while the Berry curvature is negligible. We then compute the conventional and geometric contributions to the superfluid weight. The conventional part increases linearly with the chemical potential $\mu$, a generic behaviour for Schr\"odinger-like bands. The geometric part shows a dome upon varying $\mu$, and we argue that this is a generic behaviour when the quantum metric is peaked at the zero-filling point (where the filling starts). Both contributions can be of the same order when we include disorder effects, yielding a dome-shaped superfluid weight as a function of the chemical potential. Experimentally, a dome-shaped superconducting temperature is observed when the gate voltage $V_g$ is changed. We suggest that this effect stems from the variation of the chemical potential with $V_g$ and that it mirrors the evolution of the conventional part of the superfluid weight up to optimal doping. Furthermore, we propose that a second superconducting dome could be found at larger values of $V_g$ , as a result of the dominant contribution of the geometric superfluid weight, which would also matter in saturating the overdoped regime of the observed dome. Such features would underscore the impact of the normal state quantum geometry on the superconducting state.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Multi-band effects in hybrid structures provide a rich playground for unconventional superconductivity. We combine two complementary approaches based on density-functional theory (DFT) and effective low-energy model theory in order to investigate the proximity effect in a Rashba surface state in contact to an $s$-wave superconductor. We discuss these synergistic approaches and combine the effective model and DFT analysis at the example of a Au/Al heterostructure. This allows us to predict finite-energy superconducting pairing due to the interplay of the Rashba surface state of Au, and hybridization with the electronic structure of superconducting Al. We investigate the nature of the induced superconducting pairing and quantify its mixed singlet-triplet character. Our findings demonstrate general recipes to explore real material systems that exhibit inter-orbital pairing away from the Fermi energy.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is equipped with the unique possibility to measure cosmic ray induced air showers simultaneously by their particle footprint on the surface with the IceTop detector and by the high-energy muonic shower component at a depth of more than 1.5 km. Since 2019 additionally two Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes, called IceAct, measure the electromagnetic component of air showers in the atmosphere above the IceCube detector. This opens the possibility to measure air shower parameters in three independent detectors and allows to improve mass composition studies with the IceCube data. One IceAct camera consists of 61 SiPM pixels in a hexagonal grid. Each pixel has a field of view of 1.5 degree resulting in an approximately 12-degree field of view per camera. A single telescope tube has a diameter of 50 cm, is built robust enough to withstand the harsh Antarctic conditions, and is able to detect cosmic ray particles with energies above approximately 10 TeV. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is trained to determine the air shower properties from IceAct data. The composition analysis is then performed using Random Forest Regression (RF). Since all three detectors have a different energy threshold, we train several RFs with different inputs, combining the different detectors and taking advantage of the lower energy threshold of the IceAct telescopes. This will result in composition measurements for different detector combinations and enables cross-checks of the results in overlapping energy bands. We present the method, parameters for data selection, and the status of this analysis.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">MAXI J181-195 is a newly discovered accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar that went outburst in June 2022. Through timing analysis with NICER and NuSTAR observations, we find a transient modulation at ~2.5 Hz during the decay period of MAXI J1816-195. The modulation is strongly correlated with a spectral hardening, and its fractional rms amplitude increases with energy. These results suggest that the modulation is likely to be produced in an unstable corona. In addition, the presence of the modulation during thermonuclear bursts indicates that it may originate from a disk-corona where the optical depth is likely the main factor affecting the modulation, rather than temperature. Moreover, we find significant reflection features in the spectra observed simultaneously by NICER and NuSTAR, including a relativistically broadened Fe-K line around 6-7 keV, and a Compton hump in the 10-30 keV energy band. The radius of the inner disc is constrained to be Rin = (1.04-1.23) RISCO based on reflection modeling of the broadband spectra. Assuming that the inner disc is truncated at the magnetosphere radius, we estimate that the magnetic field strength is &lt; 4.67 * 10e8 G.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Two-dimensional (2D) material heterostructures have attracted considerable attention owing to their interesting and novel physical properties, which expand the possibilities for future optoelectronic, photovoltaic, and nanoelectronic applications. A portable, fast, and deterministic transfer technique is highly needed for the fabrication of heterostructures. Herein, we report a fast half wet poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) transfer process utilizing the change of adhesion energy with the help of micron-sized water droplets. Using this method, a vertical stacking of the WS2/Bi2Se3 heterostructure with a straddling band configuration is successfully assembled on a fluorophlogopite substrate. Thanks to the complementary band gaps and high efficiency of interfacial charge transfer, the photodetector based on the heterostructure exhibits a superior responsivity of 109.9 A/W for a visible incident light at 473 nm and 26.7 A/W for a 1064 nm near-infrared illumination. Such high photoresponsivity of the heterostructure demonstrates that our transfer method not only owns time efficiency but also ensures high quality of the heterointerface. Our study may open new pathways to the fast and massive fabrication of various vertical 2D heterostructures for applications in twistronics/valleytronics and other band engineering devices.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">The Berry phase is an important concept in solids, correlated to the band topology, axion electrodynamics and potential applications of topological materials. Here, we investigate the magnetotransport and Berry phase of rare earth element Gd doped Bi2Se3 (Gd_Bi2Se3) topological insulator at low temperatures and high magnetic fields. Gd_Bi2Se3 single crystals show Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations with nontrivial Berry phase while Bi2Se3 single crystals show zero Berry phase in SdH oscillations. The temperature dependent magnetization curves can be well fitted with the Curie-Weiss law in 3-300 K region, indicating no magnetic ordering in Gd_Bi2Se3 crystals. Moreover, Gd doping has limited influence on the quantum oscillation parameters (e.g., frequency of oscillations, the area of the Fermi surface, effective electron mass, Fermi wave vectors etc.), but has an impact on the Hall mobility, carrier density, and band topology. Our results demonstrate that Gd doping can tune the Berry phase of topological insulators effectively, which may pave a way for the future realization of many predicted exotic transport phenomena of topological origin.</td>
