<td style="text-align: center;">There are few known exponential speedups for quantum algorithms and these tend to fall into even fewer families. One speedup that has mostly resisted generalization is the use of quantum walks to traverse the welded-tree graph, due to Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann, and Spielman. We show how to generalize this to a large class of hierarchical graphs in which the vertices are grouped into ``supervertices'' which are arranged according to a $d$-dimensional lattice. Supervertices can have different sizes, and edges between supervertices correspond to random connections between their constituent vertices.   The hitting times of quantum walks on these graphs are related to the localization properties of zero modes in certain disordered tight binding Hamiltonians. The speedups range from superpolynomial to exponential, depending on the underlying dimension and the random graph model. We also provide concrete realizations of these hierarchical graphs, and introduce a general method for constructing graphs with efficient quantum traversal times using graph sparsification.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>IPv6 Hitlists at Scale: Be Careful What You Wish For</strong></td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Today's network measurements rely heavily on Internet-wide scanning, employing tools like ZMap that are capable of quickly iterating over the entire IPv4 address space. Unfortunately, IPv6's vast address space poses an existential threat for Internet-wide scans and traditional network measurement techniques. To address this reality, efforts are underway to develop ``hitlists'' of known-active IPv6 addresses to reduce the search space for would-be scanners. As a result, there is an inexorable push for constructing as large and complete a hitlist as possible.   This paper asks: what are the potential benefits and harms when IPv6 hitlists grow larger? To answer this question, we obtain the largest IPv6 active-address list to date: 7.9 billion addresses, 898 times larger than the current state-of-the-art hitlist. Although our list is not comprehensive, it is a significant step forward and provides a glimpse into the type of analyses possible with more complete hitlists.   We compare our dataset to prior IPv6 hitlists and show both benefits and dangers. The benefits include improved insight into client devices (prior datasets consist primarily of routers), outage detection, IPv6 roll-out, previously unknown aliased networks, and address assignment strategies. The dangers, unfortunately, are severe: we expose widespread instances of addresses that permit user tracking and device geolocation, and a dearth of firewalls in home networks. We discuss ethics and security guidelines to ensure a safe path towards more complete hitlists.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Miscalibration of gaze tracking devices and the resulting need for repeat calibration are a significant barrier to use. As devices miscalibrate, people tend to auto-correct by gazing at neighboring targets, which makes it difficult to detect miscalibration from eye signals. To address this problem, we provide a novel and simple insight for autocalibrating eye trackers during gaze typing: the eyes are used as both input (i.e. typing) and output (i.e. reading) signals, but auto-correction by users only occurs when eye gaze is functioning as input. Thus, output eye gaze signals during reading can help systems detect the miscalibration offset and enable autocalibration. To demonstrate the potential for this type of approach, we designed and built an auto-calibration system for gaze typing and ran a user study with 15 able-bodied participants. Results from our user study suggest that such an implicit approach to autocalibration can significantly improve typing speed and overall user experience for gaze typing interfaces. Insights from our work are applicable to a broad set of gaze tracking technologies and may help create more seamless user experiences in a variety of domains.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Reliable quantum technology requires knowledge of the dynamics governing the underlying system. This problem of characterizing and benchmarking quantum devices or experiments in continuous time is referred to as the Hamiltonian learning problem. In contrast to multi-qubit systems, learning guarantees for the dynamics of bosonic systems have hitherto remained mostly unexplored. For $m$-mode Hamiltonians given as polynomials in annihilation and creation operators with modes arranged on a lattice, we establish a simple moment criterion in terms of the particle number operator which ensures that learning strategies from the finite-dimensional setting extend to the bosonic setting, requiring only coherent states and heterodyne detection on the experimental side. We then propose an enhanced procedure based on added dissipation that even works if the Hamiltonian time evolution violates this moment criterion: With high success probability it learns all coefficients of the Hamiltonian to accuracy $\varepsilon$ using a total evolution time of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}\log(m))$. Our protocol involves the experimentally reachable resources of projected coherent state preparation, dissipative regularization akin to recent quantum error correction schemes involving cat qubits stabilized by a nonlinear multi-photon driven dissipation process, and heterodyne measurements. As a crucial step in our analysis, we establish our moment criterion and a new Lieb-Robinson type bound for the evolution generated by an arbitrary bosonic Hamiltonian of bounded degree in the annihilation and creation operators combined with photon-driven dissipation. Our work demonstrates that a broad class of bosonic Hamiltonians can be efficiently learned from simple quantum experiments, and our bosonic Lieb-Robinson bound may independently serve as a versatile tool for studying evolutions on continuous variable systems.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors are becoming available on modern mobile devices and provide a 3D sensing capability. This new capability is beneficial for perceptions in various use cases, but it is challenging for resource-constrained mobile devices to use the perceptions in real-time because of their high computational complexity. In this context, edge computing can be used to enable LiDAR online perceptions, but offloading the perceptions on the edge server requires a low-latency, lightweight, and efficient compression due to the large volume of LiDAR point clouds data.   This paper presents FLiCR, a fast and lightweight LiDAR point cloud compression method for enabling edge-assisted online perceptions. FLiCR is based on range images (RI) as an intermediate representation (IR), and dictionary coding for compressing RIs. FLiCR achieves its benefits by leveraging lossy RIs, and we show the efficiency of bytestream compression is largely improved with quantization and subsampling. In addition, we identify the limitation of current quality metrics for presenting the entropy of a point cloud, and introduce a new metric that reflects both point-wise and entropy-wise qualities for lossy IRs. The evaluation results show FLiCR is more suitable for edge-assisted real-time perceptions than the existing LiDAR compressions, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our compression and metric with the evaluations on 3D object detection and LiDAR SLAM.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">We predict energetically and dynamically stable ternary Carbon-Phosphorous-Arsenic (CPAs2) monolayers in buckled geometric structure by employing density functional theory based calculations. We consider three different symmetric configurations, namely, inversion (i), mirror (m) and rotational (r). The low-energy dispersions in electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) around the Fermi level contain two contrasting features: (a) parabolic dispersion around highly symmetric Gamma point with a step function in DOS due to nearly-free-particle-like Schroedinger-Fermions and (b) linear dispersion around highly symmetric K point with linear DOS due to massless Dirac-Fermions for i-CPAs2 monolayer. The step function in DOS is a consequence of two-dimensionality of the system in which the motion of nearly-free-particles is confined. However, a closer look at (b) reveals that the ternary monolayers possess distinct characters, namely (i) massless-gapless, (ii) slightly massive-gapped and (iii) unpinned massless-gapless Dirac-Fermions for i, m and r-CPAs2 configurations respectively. Thus, the nature of states around the Fermi level depends crucially on the symmetry of systems. In addition, we probe the influence of mechanical strain on the properties of CPAs2 monolayer. The results indicate that the characteristic dispersions of (a) and (b) move in opposite directions in energy which leads to a metal-to-semimetal transition in i and r-CPAs2 configurations, for a few percentages of tensile strain. On the other hand, a strain induced metal-to-semiconductor transition is observed in m-CPAs2 configuration with a tunable energy band gap. Interestingly, unlike graphene, the Dirac cones can be unpinned from highly symmetric K (and K') point, but they are restricted to move along the edges (K-M'-K') of first Brillouin zone due to C2 symmetry in i and r-CPAs2 configurations.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Quantum computing is in an era defined by rapidly evolving quantum hardware technologies, combined with persisting high gate error rates, large amounts of noise, and short coherence times. Overcoming these limitations requires systems-level approaches that account for the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying hardware technology. Yet few hardware-aware compiler techniques exist for neutral atom devices, with no prior work on compiling to the neutral atom native gate set. In particular, current neutral atom hardware does not support certain single-qubit rotations via local addressing, which often requires the circuit to be decomposed into a large number of gates, leading to long circuit durations and low overall fidelities.   We propose the first compiler designed to overcome the challenges of limited local addressibility in neutral atom quantum computers. We present algorithms to decompose circuits into the neutral atom native gate set, with emphasis on optimizing total pulse area of global gates, which dominate gate execution costs in several current architectures. Furthermore, we explore atom movement as an alternative to expensive gate decompositions, gaining immense speedup with routing, which remains a huge overhead for many quantum circuits. Our decomposition optimizations result in up to ~3.5x and ~2.9x speedup in time spent executing global gates and time spent executing single-qubit gates, respectively. When combined with our atom movement routing algorithms, our compiler achieves up to ~10x reduction in circuit duration, with over ~2x improvement in fidelity. We show that our compiler strategies can be adapted for a variety of hardware-level parameters as neutral atom technology continues to develop.</td>

It constitutes the chemical analog of a recently studied electronic demon. We characterize its scaling behavior in the macroscopic limit, its performances, and the impact of potential internal delays. We obtain analytical expressions for all quantities of interest, namely, the generated reverse chemical current, the output power, the transduction efficiency, and the correlations between the numbers of molecules. Due to a bound on the nonequilibrium response of its chemical reaction network, we find that, contrary to the electronic case, there is no way for the Maxwell demon to generate a finite output in the macroscopic limit. Finally, we analyze the information thermodynamics of the Maxwell demon from a bipartite perspective. In the limit of a fast demon, the information flow is obtained, its pattern in the state space is discussed, and the behavior of the partial efficiencies related to the measurement and the feedback processes is examined.</td>

In this work, we introduce a new water-soluble sacrificial layer, "super-tetragonal" Sr4Al2O7 (SAOT). Its unique atomic structure ensures a coherent growth of perovskite ABO3/SAOT heterostructures, effectively inhibiting crack formation in the water-released membranes. For various non-ferroelectric oxide membranes with lattice constants ranging from 3.85 to 4.04 A, the crack-free areas can span up to millimeter-scale. The high water-solubility of SAOT shortens the exfoliation duration to a few minutes only. Our findings highlight the SAOT as an effective and versatile sacrificial layer for freestanding oxide membranes with superior integrity, crystallinity, and functionalities, further promoting their potential for innovative device applications.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">The newly discovered high-temperature superconductivity in La$<em z_2="z^2">3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has attracted a great deal of interests. The essential ingredient characterizing the electronic properties is the bilayer NiO$_2$ planes, in which the two layers couple with each other from the bonding of Ni-$3d</em>$ orbital through the intermediate oxygen-atoms. In the strong coupling limit, an intralayer antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interaction $J_{\parallel}$ between $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and an interlayer one $J_{\perp}$ between $3d_{z^2}$ orbitals are generated. Taking into account the Hund's rule at each site and integrating out the $3d_{z^2}$ spin of freedom, the system reduces to a single-orbital bilayer $t$-$J$ model of the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$. Based on the slave-boson approach, the self-consistent equation for the hopping and pairing order parameters is solved. Near the relevant $\frac{1}{4}$-filling regime (doping $\delta=0.3\sim 0.5$), the inter-layer coupling $J_{\perp}$ tunes the conventional single-layer $d$-wave superconducting state to the $s$-wave one. A strong $J_{\perp}$ could enhance the intra-layer superconducting order, leading to a dramatically increased $T_c$. Interestingly, there could exist a finite regime in which an $s+id$ state emerges.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">The axion-gluon coupling is the defining feature of the QCD axion. This feature induces additional and qualitatively different interactions of the axion with standard model particles -- quadratic couplings. Previously, hadronic quadratic couplings have been studied and experimental implications have been explored especially in the context of atomic spectroscopy and interferometry. We investigate additional quadratic couplings to the electromagnetic field and electron mass. These electromagnetic quadratic couplings are generated at the loop level from threshold corrections and are expected to be present in the absence of fine-tuning. While they are generally loop-suppressed compared to the hadronic ones, they open up new ways to search for the QCD axion, for instance via optical atomic clocks. Moreover, due to the velocity spread of the dark matter field, the quadratic nature of the coupling leads to low-frequency fluctuations in any detector setup. These distinctive low-frequency fluctuations offer a way to search for heavier axions. We provide an analytic expression for the power spectral density of this low-frequency background and briefly discuss experimental strategies for a low-frequency background search.</td>

While there is $1$--$2\sigma$ agreement in the cross section with MINERvA data for each bin in $Q^2$, we identify three regions with different relevance and opportunity for LQCD predictions. For $Q^2 \lesssim 0.2~\mathrm{GeV}^2$, the phenomenological extractions have large number of data points and LQCD is competitive, while MINERvA data have large errors. For $0.2~\mathrm{GeV}^2 \lesssim Q^2 \lesssim 1~\mathrm{GeV}^2$, LQCD is competitive with the MINERvA determination, and both give values larger than from phenomenological extraction. For $Q^2 &gt; 1~\mathrm{GeV}^2$, the MINERvA data are the most precise. Our analysis indicates that with improving precision of MINERvA-like and LQCD data, the uncertainty in the nucleon axial-vector form factor will be steadily reduced.</td>

The spectral functions exhibit distinct features such as the electron-like dispersion of low-energy states near the $\Gamma$ point, the maximum M-point intensity of mid-energy states, and the hole-like dispersion of high-energy states. These features are robust and almost insensitive to the exchange model and Hund's coupling, and are in qualitative agreement with the angular-resolved photoemission spectra observed in Na$_2$IrO$_3$.

This notion was affirmed in the Ukrainian conflict escalating at the beginning of 2022, with the large-scale deployment of the Starlink satellite Internet service which consequently demonstrated the strategic importance of a free flow of information. Aside from military use, many citizens publish sensitive information on social media platforms to influence the public narrative. However, the use of satellite communication has proven to be dangerous, as the signals can be monitored by other satellites and used to triangulate the source on the ground. Unfortunately, the targeted killings of journalists have shown this threat to be effective. While the increasing deployment of satellite Internet systems gives citizens an unprecedented mouthpiece in conflicts, protecting them against localization is an unaddressed problem.   To address this threat, we present AnonSat, a novel scheme to protect satellite Internet users from triangulation. AnonSat works with cheap off-the-shelf devices, leveraging long-range wireless communication to span a local network among satellite base stations. This allows rerouting users' communication to other satellite base stations, some distance away from each user, thus, preventing their localization. AnonSat is designed for easy deployment and usability, which we demonstrate with a prototype implementation. Our large-scale network simulations using real-world data sets show the effectiveness of AnonSat in various practical settings.</td>

We show that for the dark photon ($A'$) model with scalar LDM, NA64 gives more stringent bounds for $A'$ masses $m_{A'} \leq 0.15~GeV$ than direct searches. Moreover, for the case of Majorana LDM the damping DM velocity $v$ factor, $v^2 \sim O(10^{-6})$, for the elastic LDM electron(nucleon) cross section makes direct observation of Majorana LDM extremely challenging, while the absence of this suppression in the NA64 case gives an advantage to the experiment. The similar situation takes place for pseudo-Dirac LDM. The BaBar provides the most stringent bounds for $A'$ masses $m_{A'} \geq 0.35~GeV$. For scalar LDM the direct detection experiments give more stringent bounds at $m_{A'} \geq 0.35~GeV$ while for Majorana and pseudo-Dirac LDM case, the BaBar bounds are more stringent.

The prevalence of TB is highest in low-middle-income countries, and the requirement of a portable, automated, and reliable solution is required. In this study, we compared the performance of DL-based devices on digital and analog CXR. The evaluated DL-based device can be used in resource-constraint settings.

The AUC of qXR for detecting signs of tuberculosis on the original DICOMs dataset was 0.928 with a sensitivity of 0.841 at a specificity of 0.806. At an optimal threshold, the difference in the AUC of three cellular smartphones with the original DICOMs is 0.024 (2.55%), 0.048 (5.10%), and 0.038 (1.91%).

We introduce the novel partial-information multiple access (PIMA) scheme, a semi-grant-free (GF) coordinated random access (RA) protocol for short packet transmission, with the aim of reducing the latency and packet loss of traditional multiple access schemes, as well as more recent preamble-based schemes. With PIMA, the base station (BS) acquires partial information on instantaneous traffic conditions in the partial information acquisition (PIA) sub-frame, estimating the number of active devices, i.e., having packets waiting for transmission in their queue. Based on this estimate, the BS chooses both the total number of slots to be allocated in the data transmission (DT) sub-frame and the respective user-to-slot assignment. Although collisions may still occur due to multiple users assigned to the same slot, they are drastically reduced with respect to the slotted ALOHA (SALOHA) scheme, while achieving lower latency than both time-division multiple-access (TDMA) and preamble-based protocols, due to the extremely reduced overhead of the PIA sub-frame. Finally, we analyze and assess the performance of PIMA under various activation statistics, proving the robustness of the proposed solution to the intensity of traffic, also with burst traffic.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">The two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model is widely believed to capture key ingredients of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in cuprate materials. However, compelling evidence remains elusive. In particular, various magnetic orders may emerge as strong competitors of superconducting orders. Here, we study the ground state properties of the doped 2D $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model on a square lattice via the infinite Projected Entangled-Pair State (iPEPS) method with $\mathrm{U}(1)$ or $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin symmetry. The former is compatible with antiferromagnetic orders, while the latter forbids them. Therefore, we obtain by comparison a detailed understanding of the magnetic impact on superconductivity. Moreover, an additional $t'$ term accommodates the particle-hole asymmetry, which facilitates studies on the discrepancies between electron- and hole-doped systems. We demonstrate that (i) a positive $t'/t$ significantly amplifies the strength of superconducting orders; (ii) at sufficiently large doping levels, the $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model favors a uniform state with superconducting orders instead of stripe states with charge and spin modulations; and (iii) the enhancement of magnetic frustration, by increasing either the strength of NNN interactions or the charge doping, impairs stripe orders and helps stabilize superconductivity.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Operating in the near-vicinity of marine energy devices poses significant challenges to the control of underwater vehicles, predominantly due to the presence of large magnitude wave disturbances causing hazardous state perturbations. Approaches to tackle this problem have varied, but one promising solution is to adopt predictive control methods. Given the predictable nature of ocean waves, the potential exists to incorporate disturbance estimations directly within the plant model; this requires inclusion of a wave predictor to provide online preview information. To this end, this paper presents a Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller with an integrated Deterministic Sea Wave Predictor for trajectory tracking of underwater vehicles. State information is obtained through an Extended Kalman Filter, forming a complete closed-loop strategy and facilitating online wave load estimations. The strategy is compared to a similar feed-forward disturbance mitigation scheme, showing mean performance improvements of 51% in positional error and 44.5% in attitude error. The preliminary results presented here provide strong evidence of the proposed method's high potential to effectively mitigate disturbances, facilitating accurate tracking performance even in the presence of high wave loading.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">In preparation to the CROSS $2\beta$ decay experiment, we installed a new detector suspension with magnetic dumping inside a pulse-tube cryostat of a dedicated low-background facility at the LSC (Spain). The suspension was tested with two scintillating bolometers based on large-volume 116CdWO4 (CWO-enr) and Li2MoO4 (LMO) crystals. The former, a reference device, was used for testing new noise conditions and for comparing bolometric performance of an advanced Li2MoO4 crystal developed in the framework of the CLYMENE project, in view of next-generation double-beta decay experiments like CUPID. We cooled down detectors to 15 mK and achieved high performance for all tested devices. In particular both CWO-enr and LMO bolometers demonstrated the energy resolution of 6 keV FWHM for the 2.6 MeV gamma quanta, among the best for thermal detectors based on such compounds. The baseline noise resolution (FWHM) of the CWO-enr detector was improved by 2 keV, compared to the best previous measurement of this detector in the CROSS facility, while the noise of the Ge-based optical bolometer was improved by a factor 2, to 100 eV FWHM. Despite of the evident progress in the improving of noise conditions of the set-up, we see high-frequency harmonics of a pulse-tube induced noise, suggesting a noise pick-up by cabling. Another Ge light detector was assisted with the signal amplification exploiting the Neganov-Trofimov-Luke effect, which allowed to reach 20 eV FWHM noise resolution by applying 60 V electrode bias. Highly-efficient particle identification was achieved with both detectors, despite a low scintillation efficiency of the LMO material. The radiopurity level of the LMO crystal is rather high; only traces of 210Po and 226Ra were detected (0.1 mBq/kg each), while the 228Th activity is expected to be at least an order of magnitude lower, as well as a 40K activity is found to be &lt; 6 mBq/kg.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Molecular polaritons arise when molecules interact so strongly with light that they become entangled with each other. This light-matter hybridization alters the chemical and physical properties of the molecular system and allows chemical reactions to be controlled without the use of external fields. We investigate the impact of strong light-matter coupling on the electronic structure using perturbative approaches and demonstrate that Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory can reproduce the ground state energies in optical cavities to comparable accuracy as ab initio cavity quantum electrodynamics methodologies for currently relevant coupling strengths. The method is effective in both low and high cavity frequency regimes and straightforward to implement via response functions. Furthermore, we establish simple relations between cavity-induced intermolecular forces and van der Waals forces. These findings provide valuable insight into the manipulation of ground-state polaritonic energy landscapes, shedding light on the systems and conditions in which modifications can be achieved.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Plasma simulations are powerful tools for understanding fundamental plasma science phenomena and for process optimization in applications. To ensure their quantitative accuracy, they must be validated against experiments. In this work, such an experimental validation is performed for a 1d3v particle-in-cell simulation complemented with the Monte Carlo treatment of collision processes of a capacitively coupled radio frequency plasma driven at 13.56 MHz and operated in neon gas. In a geometrically symmetric reactor the electron density in the discharge center and the spatio-temporal distribution of the electron impact excitation rate from the ground into the Ne 2p$_1$ state are measured by a microwave cutoff probe and phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy, respectively. The measurements are conducted for electrode gaps between 50 mm and 90 mm, neutral gas pressures between 20 mTorr and 50 mTorr, and peak-to-peak values of the driving voltage waveform between 250 V and 650 V. Simulations are performed under identical discharge conditions. In the simulations, various combinations of surface coefficients characterising the interactions of electrons and heavy particles with the anodized aluminium electrode surfaces are adopted. We find, that the simulations using a constant effective heavy particle induced secondary electron emission coefficient of 0.3 and a realistic electron-surface interaction model (which considers energy-dependent and material specific elastic and inelastic electron reflection, as well as the emission of true secondary electrons from the surface) yield results which are in good quantitative agreement with the experimental data.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Recently signatures of superconductivity were observed close to 80 K in La$<em 2="2">{3}$Ni$</em>$O$<em 3="3">{7}$ under pressure [1]. This discovery positions La$</em>$Ni$<em 7="7">{2}$O$</em>$ as the first bulk nickelate with high-temperature superconductivity, but the lack of zero resistance presents a significant drawback for validating the findings. Here we show that La$<em 2="2">{3}$Ni$</em>$O$<em 3="3">{7}$ exhibits zero resistance upon applying hydrostatic pressure up to 29.2~GPa using a liquid pressure medium. We find that La$</em>$Ni$<em 7="7">{2}$O$</em>$ remains metallic under applied pressures, suggesting the absence of a metal-insulator transition proximate to the superconductivity. Analysis of the normal state $T$-linear resistance suggests an intricate link between this strange metal behaviour and superconductivity, whereby at high pressures both the linear resistance coefficient and superconducting transition are slowly suppressed by pressure, while at intermediate pressures both the superconductivity and strange metal behaviour appear disrupted, possibly due to a nearby structural instability. The association between strange metal behaviour and high-temperature superconductivity is very much in line with diverse classes of unconventional superconductors, including the cuprates and iron-pnictides [2-6]. Understanding the superconductivity of La$<em 2="2">{3}$Ni$</em>$O$_{7}$ evidently requires further revealing the interplay of strange metal behaviour, superconductivity, as well as possible competing electronic or structural phases.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">In this work, we measured the polarization properties of the X-rays emitted from the X-ray tubes, which were used during the calibration of the instrument onboard Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). X-ray tubes are used as a source of unpolarized X-rays to calibrate the response of the gas pixel detectors to unpolarized radiation. However, even though the characteristic fluorescent emission lines are unpolarized, continuum bremsstrahlung emission can be polarized based on the geometry of the accelerated electrons and emitted photons. Hence, characterizing the contribution of polarized X-rays from bremsstrahlung emission is of interest, also for future measurements. We find that when accelerated electrons are parallel to the emitted photons, the bremsstrahlung emission is unpolarized, and when they are perpendicular, the polarization increases with energy, as expected from the theoretical predictions. A comparison with the theoretical predictions is also shown.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">In this work we use a phenomenological theory of ferroelectric switching in BiFeO$_3$ thin films to uncover the mechanism of the two-step process that leads to the reversal of the weak magnetization of these materials. First, we introduce a realistic model of a BiFeO$_3$ film, including the Landau energy of isolated domains as well as the constraints that account for the presence of the substrate and the multidomain configuration found experimentally. We use this model to obtain statistical information about the switching behavior - by running dynamical simulations based on the Landau-Khalatnikov time-evolution equation, including thermal fluctuations - and we thus identify the factors that drive the two-step polarization reversal observed in the experiments. Additionally, we apply our model to test potential strategies for optimizing the switching characteristics.</td>
