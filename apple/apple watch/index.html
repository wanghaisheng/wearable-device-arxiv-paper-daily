<td style="text-align: center;">We investigate some effects of the lack of compactness in the critical Sobolev embedding by proving that a famous conjecture of Brezis &amp; Peletier (Essays in honor of Ennio De Giorgi -- Progr. Differ. Equ. Appl. 1989) does still hold in the Heisenberg framework: optimal functions for a natural subcritical approximations of the Sobolev quotient concentrate energy at one point which can be localized via the Green function associated to the involved domain and in clear accordance with the underlying sub-Riemannian geometry -- and consequently a new suitable definition of domains geometrical regular near their characteristic set is given. In order to achieve the aforementioned result, we need to combine proper estimates and tools to attack the related CR Yamabe equation (Jerison &amp; Lee, J. Diff. Geom. 1987) with novel feasible ingredients in PDEs and Calculus of Variations which also aim to constitute general independent results in the Heisenberg framework, as e.g. a fine asymptotic control of the optimal functions via the Jerison &amp; Lee extremals realizing the equality in the critical Sobolev inequality (J. Amer. Math. Soc. 1988).</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Gabriella Puppo et.al.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14685v1">2307.14685v1</a></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">null</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Many interesting physical problems described by systems of hyperbolic conservation laws are stiff, and thus impose a very small time-step because of the restrictive CFL stability condition. In this case, one can exploit the superior stability properties of implicit time integration which allows to choose the time-step only from accuracy requirements, and thus avoid the use of small time-steps. We discuss an efficient framework to devise high order implicit schemes for stiff hyperbolic systems without tailoring it to a specific problem. The nonlinearity of high order schemes, due to space- and time-limiting procedures which control nonphysical oscillations, makes the implicit time integration difficult, e.g.~because the discrete system is nonlinear also on linear problems. This nonlinearity of the scheme is circumvented as proposed in (Puppo et al., Comm.~Appl.~Math.~\&amp; Comput., 2023) for scalar conservation laws, where a first order implicit predictor is computed to freeze the nonlinear coefficients of the essentially non-oscillatory space reconstruction, and also to achieve limiting in time. In addition, we propose a novel conservative flux-based a-posteriori time-limiting procedure using numerical entropy indicators to detect troubled cells. The numerical tests involve classical and artificially devised stiff problems using the Euler's system of gas-dynamics.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">YouTube provides features for users to indicate disinterest when presented with unwanted recommendations, such as the <code>Not interested'' and</code>Don\'t recommend channel'' buttons. These buttons are purported to allow the user to correct <code>mistakes'' made by the recommendation system. Yet, relatively little is known about the empirical efficacy of these buttons. Neither is much known about users' awareness of and confidence in them. To address these gaps, we simulated YouTube users with sock puppet agents. Each agent first executed a</code>stain phase'', where it watched many videos of one assigned topic; then it executed a <code>scrub phase'', where it tried to remove recommendations of the assigned topic. Each agent repeatedly applied a single scrubbing strategy, which included disliking previously-watched videos or deleting them from watch history, as well as clicking the</code>not interested'' or <code>don\'t recommend channel'' button on newly-recommended videos. Overall, we found that the stain phase significantly increased the fraction of the recommended videos on the user\'s homepage dedicated to the assigned topic. For the scrub phase, using the</code>Not interested'' button worked best, significantly reducing such recommendations in all topics tested, on average removing 88\% of them. Neither the stain phase nor the scrub phase, however, had much effect on videopage recommendations (those given to users while they watch a video). We also ran a survey ($N$ =300) asking adult YouTube users in the US whether they were aware of and used these buttons before, as well as how effective they found these buttons to be. We found that 44\% of participants were not aware that the ``Not interested'' button existed. However, those who were aware of this button often used it to remove unwanted recommendations (82.8\%) and found it to be modestly effective (3.42 out of 5).</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Imbalance in the 3D structure of plants can be an important indicator of insufficient light or nutrient supply, as well as excessive wind, (formerly present) physical barriers, neighbor or storm damage. It can also be a simple means to detect certain illnesses, since some diseases like the apple proliferation disease, an infection with the barley yellow dwarf virus or plant canker can cause abnormal growth, like \enquote{witches' brooms} or burls, resulting in a deviating 3D plant architecture. However, quantifying imbalance of plant growth is not an easy task, and it requires a mathematically sound 3D model of plants to which imbalance indices can be applied. Current models of plants are often based on stacked cylinders or voxel matrices and do not allow for measuring the degree of 3D imbalance in the branching structure of the whole plant.   On the other hand, various imbalance indices are readily available for so-called graph-theoretical trees and are frequently used in areas like phylogenetics and computer science. While only some basic ideas of these indices can be transferred to the 3D setting, graph-theoretical trees are a logical foundation for 3D plant models that allow for elegant and natural imbalance measures.   In this manuscript, our aim is thus threefold: We first present a new graph-theoretical 3D model of plants and discuss desirable properties of imbalance measures in the 3D setting. We then introduce and analyze eight different imbalance indices and their properties. Thirdly, we illustrate all our findings using a data set of 63 bush beans. Moreover, we implemented all our indices in the publicly available \textsf{R}-software package \textsf{treeDbalance} accompanying this manuscript.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">It is known that the generating function associated with the enumeration of non-backtracking walks on finite graphs is a rational matrix-valued function of the parameter; such function is also closely related to graph-theoretical results such as Ihara's theorem and the zeta function on graphs. In [P. Grindrod, D. J. Higham, V. Noferini, The deformed graph Laplacian and its application to network centrality analysis, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. 39(1), 310--341, 2018], the radius of convergence of the generating function was studied for simple (i.e., undirected, unweighted and with no loops) graphs, and shown to depend on the number of cycles in the graph. In this paper, we use technologies from the theory of polynomial and rational matrices to greatly extend these results by studying the radius of convergence of the corresponding generating function for general, possibly directed and/or weighted, graphs. We give an analogous characterization of the radius of convergence for directed unweighted graphs, showing that it depends on the number of cycles in the undirectization of the graph. For weighted graphs, we provide for the first time an exact formula for the radius of convergence, improving a previous result that exhibited a lower bound. Finally, we consider also backtracking-downweighted walks on unweighted digraphs, and we prove a version of Ihara's theorem in that case.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">We present a novel multilevel Monte Carlo approach for estimating quantities of interest for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). Drawing inspiration from [Giles and Szpruch: Antithetic multilevel Monte Carlo estimation for multi-dimensional SDEs without L\'evy area simulation, Annals of Appl. Prob., 2014], we extend the antithetic Milstein scheme for finite-dimensional stochastic differential equations to Hilbert space-valued SPDEs. Our method has the advantages of both Euler and Milstein discretizations, as it is easy to implement and does not involve intractable L\'evy area terms. Moreover, the antithetic correction in our method leads to the same variance decay in a MLMC algorithm as the standard Milstein method, resulting in significantly lower computational complexity than a corresponding MLMC Euler scheme. Our approach is applicable to a broader range of non-linear diffusion coefficients and does not require any commutative properties. The key component of our MLMC algorithm is a truncated Milstein-type time stepping scheme for SPDEs, which accelerates the rate of variance decay in the MLMC method when combined with an antithetic coupling on the fine scales. We combine the truncated Milstein scheme with appropriate spatial discretizations and noise approximations on all scales to obtain a fully discrete scheme and show that the antithetic coupling does not introduce an additional bias.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">It is important to understand the dynamics of red blood cells (RBCs) in blood flow. This requires the formulation of coarse-grained RBC models that reproduce the hydrodynamic properties of blood accurately. One of the models that successfully reproduce the rheology and morphology of blood has been proposed by Fedosov et al. [D. A. Fedosov, B. Caswell, and G. E. Karniadakis, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng., Vol. 199, 1937-1948 (2010)]. The proposed RBC model contains several parameters whose values are determined either by various experiments or physical requirements. In this study, we developed a new method of determining the parameter values precisely from the fluctuations of the RBC membrane. Specifically, we studied the relationship between the spectra of the fluctuations and model parameters. Characteristic peaks were observed in the spectra, whose peak frequencies were dependent on the parameter values. In addition, we investigated the spectra of the radius of gyration. We identified the peaks originating from the spring potential and the volume-conserving potential appearing in the spectra. These results lead to the precise experimental determination of the parameters used in the RBC model.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Two-dimensional (2D) material heterostructures have attracted considerable attention owing to their interesting and novel physical properties, which expand the possibilities for future optoelectronic, photovoltaic, and nanoelectronic applications. A portable, fast, and deterministic transfer technique is highly needed for the fabrication of heterostructures. Herein, we report a fast half wet poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) transfer process utilizing the change of adhesion energy with the help of micron-sized water droplets. Using this method, a vertical stacking of the WS2/Bi2Se3 heterostructure with a straddling band configuration is successfully assembled on a fluorophlogopite substrate. Thanks to the complementary band gaps and high efficiency of interfacial charge transfer, the photodetector based on the heterostructure exhibits a superior responsivity of 109.9 A/W for a visible incident light at 473 nm and 26.7 A/W for a 1064 nm near-infrared illumination. Such high photoresponsivity of the heterostructure demonstrates that our transfer method not only owns time efficiency but also ensures high quality of the heterointerface. Our study may open new pathways to the fast and massive fabrication of various vertical 2D heterostructures for applications in twistronics/valleytronics and other band engineering devices.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">The analysis of brain signals holds considerable importance in enhancing our comprehension of diverse learning techniques and cognitive mechanisms. Game-based learning is increasingly being recognized for its interactive and engaging educational approach. A pilot study of twelve participants divided into experimental and control groups was conducted to understand its effects on cognitive processes. Both groups were provided with the same contents regarding the basic structure of the graph. The participants in the experimental group engaged in a quiz-based game, while those in the control group watched a pre-recorded video. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) was employed to acquire cerebral signals, and a series of pre and post-tests were administered. The findings of our study indicate that the group engaged in the game activity displayed elevated levels of oxygenated hemoglobin compared to the group involved in watching videos. Conversely, the deoxygenated hemoglobin levels remained relatively consistent across both groups throughout the learning process. The aforementioned findings suggest that the use of game-based learning has a substantial influence on cognitive processes. Furthermore, it is evident that both the game and video groups exhibited higher neural activity in the Lateral Prefrontal cortex (PFC). The oxygenated hemoglobin ratio demonstrates that the game group had 2.33 times more neural processing in the Lateral PFC than the video group. This data is further supported by the knowledge gain analysis, which indicates that the game-based approach resulted in a 47.74% higher knowledge gain than the video group, as calculated from the difference in pre-and post-test scores.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">In this paper we tackle the problem of surfactant spreading on a thin liquid film in the framework of isogeometric analysis. We consider a mathematical model that describes this phenomenon as an initial boundary value problem (IBVP) that includes two coupled fourth order partial differential equations (PDEs), one for the film height and one for the surfactant concentration. In order to solve this problem numerically, it is customary to transform it into a mixed problem that includes at most second order PDEs. However, the higher-order continuity of the approximation functions in Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) allows us to deal with the weak form of the fourth order PDEs directly, without the need of resorting to mixed methods. We demonstrate numerically that the IGA solution is able to reproduce results obtained before with mixed approaches. Complex phenomena such as Marangoni-driven fingering instabilities triggered by perturbations are easily captured.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">With the popularity of smartphones and tablets, users have become accustomed to using different devices for different tasks, such as using their phones to play games and tablets to watch movies. To conquer the market, one app is often available on both smartphones and tablets. However, although one app has similar graphic user interfaces (GUIs) and functionalities on phone and tablet, current app developers typically start from scratch when developing a tablet-compatible version of their app, which drives up development costs and wastes existing design resources. Researchers are attempting to employ deep learning in automated GUIs development to enhance developers' productivity. Deep learning models rely heavily on high-quality datasets. There are currently several publicly accessible GUI page datasets for phones, but none for pairwise GUIs between phones and tablets. This poses a significant barrier to the employment of deep learning in automated GUI development. In this paper, we collect and make public the Papt dataset, which is a pairwise dataset for GUI conversion and retrieval between Android phones and tablets. The dataset contains 10,035 phone-tablet GUI page pairs from 5,593 phone-tablet app pairs. We illustrate the approaches of collecting pairwise data and statistical analysis of this dataset. We also illustrate the advantages of our dataset compared to other current datasets. Through preliminary experiments on this dataset, we analyse the present challenges of utilising deep learning in automated GUI development and find that our dataset can assist the application of some deep learning models to tasks involving automatic GUI development.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">As with any machine learning problem with limited data, effective offline RL algorithms require careful regularization to avoid overfitting. One-step methods perform regularization by doing just a single step of policy improvement, while critic regularization methods do many steps of policy improvement with a regularized objective. These methods appear distinct. One-step methods, such as advantage-weighted regression and conditional behavioral cloning, truncate policy iteration after just one step. This ``early stopping'' makes one-step RL simple and stable, but can limit its asymptotic performance. Critic regularization typically requires more compute but has appealing lower-bound guarantees. In this paper, we draw a close connection between these methods: applying a multi-step critic regularization method with a regularization coefficient of 1 yields the same policy as one-step RL. While practical implementations violate our assumptions and critic regularization is typically applied with smaller regularization coefficients, our experiments nevertheless show that our analysis makes accurate, testable predictions about practical offline RL methods (CQL and one-step RL) with commonly-used hyperparameters. Our results that every problem can be solved with a single step of policy improvement, but rather that one-step RL might be competitive with critic regularization on RL problems that demand strong regularization.</td>

Here, we report ~ 3.5 - 4 V rechargeable lithium/chlorine (Li/Cl2) batteries operating down to -80 {\deg}C, employing Li metal negative electrode, a novel CO2 activated porous carbon (KJCO2) as the positive electrode, and a high ionic conductivity (~ 5 to 20 mS cm-1 from -80 {\deg}C to 25 {\deg}C) electrolyte comprised of 1 M aluminum chloride (AlCl3), 0.95 M lithium chloride (LiCl), and 0.05 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in low melting point (-104.5 {\deg}C) thionyl chloride (SOCl2). Between room-temperature and -80 {\deg}C, the Li/Cl2 battery delivered up to ~ 30,000 - 4,500 mAh g-1 first discharge capacity and a 1,200 - 5,000 mAh g-1 reversible capacity (discharge voltages in ~ 3.5 to 3.1 V) over up to 130 charge-discharge cycles. Mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) probed Cl2 trapped in the porous carbon upon LiCl electro-oxidation during charging. At lower temperature down to -80 {\deg}C, SCl2/S2Cl2 and Cl2 generated by electro-oxidation in the charging step were trapped in porous KJCO2 carbon, allowing for reversible reduction to afford a high discharge voltage plateau near ~ 4 V with up to ~ 1000 mAh g-1 capacity for SCl2/S2Cl2 reduction and up to ~ 4000 mAh g-1 capacity at ~ 3.1 V plateau for Cl2 reduction.

Also, we prove that the corresponding MRD-codes and $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear sets of $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^6)$ are not equivalent to the previously known ones.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) is a popular technique used to generate motion for dynamic-legged robots in the recent past. However, in most cases, only the first-order partial derivatives of the underlying dynamics are used, resulting in the iLQR approach. Neglecting the second-order terms often slows down the convergence rate compared to full DDP. Multi-Shooting is another popular technique to improve robustness, especially if the dynamics are highly non-linear. In this work, we consider Multi-Shooting DDP for trajectory optimization of a bounding gait for a simplified quadruped model. As the main contribution, we develop Second-Order analytical partial derivatives of the rigid-body contact dynamics, extending our previous results for fixed/floating base models with multi-DoF joints. Finally, we show the benefits of a novel Quasi-Newton method for approximating second-order derivatives of the dynamics, leading to order-of-magnitude speedups in the convergence compared to the full DDP method.</td>

However, the significant differences in screen size, aspect ratio, and interaction styles make it challenging to adapt Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) across these devices.   Although there are millions of apps available on Google Play, only a few thousand are designed to support smart TV displays.   Existing techniques to map a mobile app GUI to a TV either adopt a responsive design, which struggles to bridge the substantial gap between phone and TV or use mirror apps for improved video display, which requires hardware support and extra engineering efforts.   Instead of developing another app for supporting TVs, we propose a semi-automated approach to generate corresponding adaptive TV GUIs, given the phone GUIs as the input.   Based on our empirical study of GUI pairs for TV and phone in existing apps, we synthesize a list of rules for grouping and classifying phone GUIs, converting them to TV GUIs, and generating dynamic TV layouts and source code for the TV display.   Our tool is not only beneficial to developers but also to GUI designers, who can further customize the generated GUIs for their TV app development.   An evaluation and user study demonstrate the accuracy of our generated GUIs and the usefulness of our tool.</td>

To blur the boundaries between spectators and players, we propose a novel approach called ''Fused Spectatorship'', where spectators watch their hands play games by loaning bodily control to a computational Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) system. To showcase this concept, we designed three games where spectators loan control over both their hands to the EMS system and watch them play these competitive and collaborative games. A study with 12 participants suggested that participants could not distinguish if they were watching their hands play, or if they were playing the games themselves. We used our results to articulate four spectator experience themes and four fused spectator types, the behaviours they elicited and offer one design consideration to support each of these behaviours. We also discuss the ethical design considerations of our approach to help game designers create future fused spectatorship experiences.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">The emergence of water-proof mobile and wearable devices (e.g., Garmin Descent and Apple Watch Ultra) designed for underwater activities like professional scuba diving, opens up opportunities for underwater networking and localization capabilities on these devices. Here, we present the first underwater acoustic positioning system for smart devices. Unlike conventional systems that use floating buoys as anchors at known locations, we design a system where a dive leader can compute the relative positions of all other divers, without any external infrastructure. Our intuition is that in a well-connected network of devices, if we compute the pairwise distances, we can determine the shape of the network topology. By incorporating orientation information about a single diver who is in the visual range of the leader device, we can then estimate the positions of all the remaining divers, even if they are not within sight. We address various practical problems including detecting erroneous distance estimates, addressing rotational and flipping ambiguities as well as designing a distributed timestamp protocol that scales linearly with the number of devices. Our evaluations show that our distributed system running on underwater deployments of 4-5 commodity smart devices can perform pairwise ranging and localization with median errors of 0.5-0.9 m and 0.9-1.6 m</td>

Classical Biot poroelasticity theory is adopted. The proposed approach is first verified by comparing its results with the exact solutions of two examples. Subsequently, a series of pressure- and fluid-driven crack propagation examples are solved and presented. The phenomenon of fluid pressure oscillation is observed in the fluid-driven crack propagation examples, which is consistent with previous experimental and numerical evidences. All the presented examples demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in solving problems of hydraulic fracture propagation in saturated porous media.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">The mechanisms behind the success of multi-view self-supervised learning (MVSSL) are not yet fully understood. Contrastive MVSSL methods have been studied through the lens of InfoNCE, a lower bound of the Mutual Information (MI). However, the relation between other MVSSL methods and MI remains unclear. We consider a different lower bound on the MI consisting of an entropy and a reconstruction term (ER), and analyze the main MVSSL families through its lens. Through this ER bound, we show that clustering-based methods such as DeepCluster and SwAV maximize the MI. We also re-interpret the mechanisms of distillation-based approaches such as BYOL and DINO, showing that they explicitly maximize the reconstruction term and implicitly encourage a stable entropy, and we confirm this empirically. We show that replacing the objectives of common MVSSL methods with this ER bound achieves competitive performance, while making them stable when training with smaller batch sizes or smaller exponential moving average (EMA) coefficients.

<td style="text-align: center;">Let $Z_t^{(0,\infty)}$ be the point process formed by the positions of all particles alive at time $t$ in a branching Brownian motion with drift and killed upon reaching 0. We study the asymptotic expansions of $Z_t^{(0,\infty)}(A)$ for $A= (a,b)$ and $A=(a,\infty)$ under the assumption that $\sum_{k=1}^\infty k(\log k)^{1+\lambda} p_k &lt;\infty$ for large $\lambda$ in the regime of $\theta \in [0,\sqrt{2})$. These results extend and sharpen the results of Louidor and Saglietti [J. Stat. Phys, 2020] and Kesten [Stochastic Process. Appl., 1978].</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Self-supervised monocular depth estimation (SS-MDE) has the potential to scale to vast quantities of data. Unfortunately, existing approaches limit themselves to the automotive domain, resulting in models incapable of generalizing to complex environments such as natural or indoor settings.   To address this, we propose a large-scale SlowTV dataset curated from YouTube, containing an order of magnitude more data than existing automotive datasets. SlowTV contains 1.7M images from a rich diversity of environments, such as worldwide seasonal hiking, scenic driving and scuba diving. Using this dataset, we train an SS-MDE model that provides zero-shot generalization to a large collection of indoor/outdoor datasets. The resulting model outperforms all existing SSL approaches and closes the gap on supervised SoTA, despite using a more efficient architecture.   We additionally introduce a collection of best-practices to further maximize performance and zero-shot generalization. This includes 1) aspect ratio augmentation, 2) camera intrinsic estimation, 3) support frame randomization and 4) flexible motion estimation.

<td style="text-align: center;">The aim of this study was to determine the germination ability and seedling growth of the apple of Sodom by soaking in water, gibberellin (GA3), naphthylacetic acid (NAA), and salicylic acid (SA), separately. The findings showed that NAA at 50 mgL-1 produced superior germination (77.78%), germination speed (1.43 seeds/time interval), hypocotyl length (1.01 cm), hypocotyl diameter (1.13 mm), leaf number (2.66), and root number (17.25), followed by 50 and 100 mgL-1 GA3, particularly in germination percentage. The best root length (5.33 cm) was detected at 100 mgL-1 SA. In contrast, control seeds and water-soaked seeds showed inferior results. The seeds of the apple of Sodom can be germinated successfully as a result of treatment with NAA at 50 mgL-1, followed by GA3 at 50 and 100 mgL-1.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">The use of nanophotonics for optical manipulation has continuously attracted interest in both fundamental research and practical applications, due to its significantly enhanced capabilities at the nanoscale. In this work, we showed that plasmonic particles can be trapped at off-axis location in Gaussian beams assisted by surface plasmon resonance. The off-axis displacement can be tuned at the sub-wavelength scale by the incident light beams. Based on these, we propose that a superfast orbital rotation of particles in continuous-wave laser beam can be realized in tightly focused circularly polarized Gaussian beams. The rotation has a tunable orbital radius at the sub-wavelength scale and a superfast rotation speed (more than 10^4 r/s in water under common laboratory conditions). Our work will aid in the development of optically driven nanomachines, and find applications in micro/nano-rheology, micro-fluid mechanics, and biological research at the nanoscale.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">The technique of muon spin rotation ({\mu}SR) has emerged in the last few decades as one of the most powerful methods of obtaining local magnetic information. To make the technique fully quantitative, it is necessary to have an accurate estimate of where inside the crystal structure the muon implants. This can be provided by density functional theory calculations using an approach that is termed DFT+{\mu}, density functional theory with the implanted muon included. This article reviews this approach, describes some recent successes in particular {\mu}SR experiments, and suggests some avenues for future exploration.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">In his monograph [Classical and quantum orthogonal polynomials in one variable, Cambridge University Press, 2005 (paperback edition 2009)], Ismail conjectured that certain structure relations involving the Askey-Wilson operator characterize proper subsets of the set of all $\mathcal{D}_q$-classical orthogonal polynomials, here to be understood as the Askey-Wilson polynomials and their limit cases. In this paper we give two characterization theorems for $\mathcal{D}_q$-semiclassical (and classical) orthogonal polynomials in consonance with the pioneering works by Maroni [Ann. Mat. Pura. Appl. (1987)] and Bonan, Lubinsky, and Nevai [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 18 (1987)] for the standard derivative, re-establishing in this context the perfect "symmetry" between the standard derivative and the Askey-Wilson operator. As an application, we present a sequence of $\mathcal{D}_q$-semiclassical orthogonal polynomials of class two that disproves Ismail's conjectures. Further results are presented for Hahn's operator.</td>
